Minecraft_Support_Scripts
=========================

Some usefull bash Scripts for managing a Minecraft server.
This is just sort of a stash spot for my server matinace scripts that i have written. Feel free to grab a copy if you think they might be usefull also if youd like to make a pull request id be glad to take a look at the code and merge the improvements into the project.
It is recommended to set up SSH Auth Key pairs so these scripts can run with a crontab.

+ mc-back.sh - This script will pull a copy of the MC Server using Rsync to a local folder. chat messagess are broadcast to the server durring runtime.
